A simple installation guide for the bestwhois utility

for Windows 10 users with less technical background.


Step 1: Installing Python
-------------------------

This step is just a usual installation of a piece of software.

If you do not yet have Python3 installed
(that is, no "Python" whatevers come up when you search in applications):

- Open a browser,

- go to https://www.python.org/downloads/,

- press the button to downlad the latest version for Windows,

- say "Run" when you are asked what to do with the downloaded file.

- In the window of the installer, check the "Install launcher for all
  users" as well as "Add Python 3.8 to PATH" boxes (instead of 3.8,
  you may see another version), and

- press "Intall now". Agree whenever it says it wants to make changes
  on your system.

- at the end you have to see "Installation successful". It is also
  recommended in this phase to also check the "Disable path length
  limit" box and say O.K. if you are offered to do so.

So far you have Python on your computer.

Step 2: Installing prerequisites for the bestwhois utility
----------------------------------------------------------

Here we shall run a single command to install some prerequisites.

-Open a command-line Window. (Don't worry, it will be easy.)
 If you don't know where it is, search for "cmd" in the application search box.
 

-A black window appears with a blinking cursor. Now type there

pip install pygments argparse idna requests

and press Enter. The computer will work a bit, and report that it has
successfully installed somethings at the end.

Now your Python is extended with the features needed to run bestwhois.

It is worth keeping the command-line window open; we shall be in the need of it further.

Step 3: Install and use bestwhois
---------------------------------

Finally we will get the program working.

- Go to https://github.com/whoisxmlapi/bestwhois

- Click the green "Clone or download" button, and choose "Download zip".

- Open the downloaded file, it is a zip archive. Enter the bestwhois-master subdirectory in it.

- copy "bestwhois.py", aka the "bestwhois" Python File to your user directory, "C:\Users\your_username", where "your_username" is your username.
  (Hint: if you look at the command-line window, this directory is named before the ">" symbol in the command prompt.)

- go to the command prompt, and say

  notepad .bestwhoisrc

- A text editor will appear, and ask if you want to create the file. Create it.

- In the text editor, insert your API code. Save the file and exit.

And we are done.

Now go back to the command prompt.

If you type

    bestwhois.py whoisxmlapi.com

you will get the WHOIS record for whoisxmlapi.com.

Other options to try:

A detailed help message:
      bestwhois.py --help
Output in a textual format similar to that of the whois command:
      bestwhois.py --text whoisxmlapi.com
Display all historic records
      bestwhois.py --history whoisxmlapi.com

Do not hesitate to deliberately combine the options and experiment with it.

Remark: working with bestwhois.py in PowerShell
-----------------------------------------------

When using PowerShell, "python.py" will run, but it will open a
separate console that will disappear as soon as the results are
printed. To avoid this, bestwhois should be used with "python" in
front of it like this:

PS C:\work\bestwhois> python bestwhois.py whoisxmlapi.com

or

PS C:\work\bestwhois> python bestwhois whoisxmlapi.com

(Note that we are in the directory where "bestwhois" and
"bestwhois.py" reside; the full path may be needed otherwise.)
